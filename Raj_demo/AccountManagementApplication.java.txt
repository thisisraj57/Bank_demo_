**Class:** `AccountManagementApplication`

**Description:**

The `AccountManagementApplication` class is the main application class for a Java Spring Boot application that manages accounts in iPYMT. It serves as the entry point for the application and is responsible for bootstrapping the Spring application context.

**Method:**

* `public static void main(String[] args)`: This is the main method of the application. It initializes the Spring application context and starts the application.

**Usage:**

To use this class, you can create a new Java project and add the following code to the main class:

```java
public class MyApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

Replace `MyApplication` with the actual name of your application class. Then, you can run the application using the following command:

```
java -jar my-application.jar
```

This will start the Spring Boot application and make it ready to handle HTTP requests.
