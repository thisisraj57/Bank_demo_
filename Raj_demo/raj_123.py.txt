**Function:** `is_prime`

**Description:**

Checks if a given number is prime.

**Parameters:**

* `number`: The number to check for primality.

**Return Value:**

* `True` if the number is prime, `False` otherwise.

**Algorithm:**

1. If the number is less than or equal to 1, return `False` as prime numbers are greater than 1.
2. Iterate through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number (inclusive).
3. For each number in the range, check if the given number is divisible by it. If it is, return `False` as the number is not prime.
4. If no divisors are found in the range, return `True` as the number is prime.

**Example Usage:**

```python
>>> is_prime(7)
True
>>> is_prime(10)
False
>>> is_prime(1)
False
```
