Here is the Python code:
```python
# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(number):
    # Iterate from 2 to the square root of the given number
    for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):
        # If the number is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root, it is not prime
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    # If the number is not divisible by any number from 2 to its square root, it is prime
    return True
```

Explanation:
The provided Python code defines a function named 'is_prime' that checks if a given number is prime. The function takes a single argument 'number' which represents the number to be checked. It iterates through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number and checks if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If the number is divisible by any number, the function returns False indicating that it is not a prime number. If the number is not divisible by any number from 2 to its square root, the function returns True indicating it is a prime number.
