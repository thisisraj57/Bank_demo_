Here is the Python code:
```python
def is_prime(number): 
   if number <= 1: 
       return False
   for i in range(2, number): 
       if number % i == 0: 
           return False
   return True
```
Explanation:
This code defines a function named 'is_prime' that determines whether a given number is prime or not. Here's how it works:
- It starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function immediately returns 'False' because prime numbers are greater than 1.
- Next, it enters a for loop that starts with i set to 2 and iterates until i is less than the number. This loop checks for divisibility.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the number is divisible by i. If the remainder of the division (number % i) is 0, it means the number is divisible by i and is therefore not prime. In this case, the function returns 'False'.
- If the loop completes without finding any factors of the number, the function returns 'True' because such a number is considered prime according to the definition of prime numbers.
