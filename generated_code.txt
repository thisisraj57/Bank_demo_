Here is the Python code:

```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    """
    Checks if a string is a palindrome.

    Args:
    string: The string to check.

    Returns:
    True if the string is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    """
    # Remove non-alphanumeric characters from the string
    string = ''.join(filter(str.isalnum, string)).lower()
    # Check if the string is empty or has only one character
    if len(string) <= 1:
        return True
    # Check if the first and last characters of the string are the same
    if string[0] != string[-1]:
        return False
    # Recursively check the remaining characters of the string
    return is_palindrome(string[1:-1])
```
Explanation:
The code defines a function called 'is_palindrome' that takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome, or False otherwise. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. Here's how the code works:

1. The function first removes all non-alphanumeric characters from the input string using the filter() function. This ensures that the function is case-insensitive and ignores spaces and punctuation.

2. Next, the function checks if the length of the cleaned string is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the string is considered a palindrome because it either has no characters or only one character.

3. The function also checks if the first and last characters of the cleaned string are different. If they are different, the string is not a palindrome, and the function returns False.

4. If the first and last characters are the same, the function recursively calls itself with the remaining characters of the string (string[1:-1]). This process continues until the function reaches the base case where the string has no more characters or only one character left.

5. If the function successfully reaches the base case without finding any mismatched characters, it returns True, indicating that the original string is a palindrome.
