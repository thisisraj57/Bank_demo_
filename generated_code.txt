Here is the Mermaid code for the sequence diagram:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant App
participant StudentDataRestRepository

App->StudentDataRestRepository: calls main()
activate App
activate StudentDataRestRepository
StudentDataRestRepository->App: returns
deactivate StudentDataRestRepository
deactivate App
```

Explanation:
The Mermaid syntax for the sequence diagram describes the interactions between the application (App) and the StudentDataRestRepository. The sequence diagram shows that the App calls the main() method on the StudentDataRestRepository, which then returns. The activate and deactivate commands are used to show the active state of each participant during the interaction.
