Here is the Python code:
```python
def is_prime(number):
    """
    This function checks if a given number is prime.

    Args:
        number (int): The number to be checked for primality.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.
    """

    # Check if the number is less than or equal to 1.
    if number <= 1:
        return False

    # Iterate over all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number.
    for i in range(2, int(number ** 0.5) + 1):
        # Check if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range.
        if number % i == 0:
            # If the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it is not prime.
            return False

    # If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it is prime.
    return True
```
Explanation:
The Python code defines a function named 'is_prime' that takes an integer 'number' as input and determines if it's a prime number. Inside the function:

1. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, as prime numbers are greater than 1. If the number is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False.

2. It then iterates over a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number (+1 to include the square root).

3. For each number in the range, it checks if the input number is divisible by that number without any remainder using the modulo operator ('%'). If the remainder is 0, it means the input number is divisible by that number, indicating it's not a prime number, and the function returns False.

4. If the input number is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it means the number is prime, and the function returns True.
