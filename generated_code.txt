Explanation: The given Python program is designed to determine whether a provided number is prime or not. Prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

The function, is_prime, takes an integer, num, as its argument and proceeds to perform the primality test. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. **Boundary conditions**: The function initially checks for two boundary conditions:
   - If num is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime. This is because prime numbers are defined to be greater than 1.
   - If num is equal to 2, it is prime. This is because 2 is the smallest prime number.

2. **Iteration**: If neither of the boundary conditions is met, the code enters a loop that iterates from 2 up to the square root of num. This optimization is employed to reduce the number of iterations required to check for divisibility.

3. **Divisibility check**: In each iteration of the loop, the code checks if num is divisible evenly by the current index i. If the remainder of the division (num % i) is 0, it means that i is a factor of num, indicating that num is not prime.

4. **Prime determination**: If the loop completes without finding any factors, it means that num has no divisors other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number. The function returns True in this case.

5. **Non-prime determination**: If the loop finds a factor, the function returns False, indicating that num is not a prime number.
