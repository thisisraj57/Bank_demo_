# Documentation for Polynomial Regression Plotting Code

## Overview
This script demonstrates how to perform polynomial regression on a given set of data points and visualize the results using a scatter plot and a fitted polynomial curve. The script uses the `numpy` library for numerical operations and `matplotlib` for plotting.

## Dependencies
- `numpy`: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- `matplotlib`: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

## Code Explanation

### Import Libraries
```python
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
- `numpy` is imported for numerical operations, specifically for polynomial fitting.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` is imported for creating plots.

### Data Points
```python
x = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22]
y = [100, 90, 80, 60, 60, 55, 60, 65, 70, 70, 75, 76, 78, 79, 90, 99, 99, 100]
```
- `x` and `y` are lists of data points representing the independent and dependent variables, respectively.

### Polynomial Regression Model
```python
mymodel = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(x, y, 3))
```
- `numpy.polyfit(x, y, 3)` fits a polynomial of degree 3 to the data points `(x, y)`.
- `numpy.poly1d` creates a polynomial object from the coefficients returned by `numpy.polyfit`.

### Generate Line for Plotting
```python
myline = numpy.linspace(1, 22, 100)
```
- `numpy.linspace(1, 22, 100)` generates 100 evenly spaced values between 1 and 22. This will be used to plot the polynomial curve.

### Plotting
```python
plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.plot(myline, mymodel(myline))
plt.show()
```
- `plt.scatter(x, y)` creates a scatter plot of the original data points.
- `plt.plot(myline, mymodel(myline))` plots the polynomial regression curve.
- `plt.show()` displays the plot.

## Usage
1. Ensure that `numpy` and `matplotlib` are installed in your Python environment.
2. Copy and paste the code into a Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the script to see the scatter plot of the data points and the fitted polynomial curve.

## Example
```python
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22]
y = [100, 90, 80, 60, 60, 55, 60, 65, 70, 70, 75, 76, 78, 79, 90, 99, 99, 100]

mymodel = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(x, y, 3))

myline = numpy.linspace(1, 22, 100)

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.plot(myline, mymodel(myline))
plt.show()
```
Running this example will display a scatter plot of the data points and a polynomial curve fitted to the data.
