**Description:** This class represents an account entity in a database. It is annotated with `@Entity`, which indicates that this class is a JPA entity and can be mapped to a database table.

**Fields:**

* **id:** The unique identifier of the account. It is annotated with `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue` with the `GenerationType.AUTO` strategy, which means that the ID will be automatically generated by the database.
* **firstName:** The first name of the account holder.
* **lastName:** The last name of the account holder.
* **email:** The email address of the account holder.
* **accountNumber:** The account number.

**Getters and Setters:**

**How to use:**

You can use this class to represent account entities in your application. You can create new accounts, retrieve existing accounts, update account information, and delete accounts.

**Example:**

```java
Account account = new Account();
account.setFirstName("John");
account.setLastName("Doe");
account.setEmail("john.doe@example.com");
account.setAccountNumber("123456789");
account.setAccountType("Savings");
account.setStatus("Active");

// Save the account to the database
accountRepository.save(account);
```

This code creates a new account entity and saves it to the database using the `accountRepository`. You can then retrieve the account from the database using its ID or other criteria.
