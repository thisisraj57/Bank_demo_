**Class:** `AccountManagementApplication`

**Description:** This is the main application class that bootstraps the Spring Boot application. It is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, which combines several annotations such as `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.

**Method:** `public static void main(String[] args)`

**Description:** This is the entry point of the Spring Boot application. It is responsible for starting the application context and initializing the Spring application.

**@SpringBootApplication Annotation:**

The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is used to indicate that this class is the main application class of a Spring Boot application. It triggers auto-configuration and component scanning, and it is equivalent to using the following annotations together:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan
```

**How to use:**

To use this class, you can simply run the `main` method, which will start the Spring Boot application and load the application context.

**Example:**

```java
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

When you run this code, it will start a Spring Boot application and automatically configure various components based on the classpath and application properties. You can then use Spring's annotations and features to develop your application.
