**Java Spring Boot Application for Account Management in iPYMT**

**Purpose:**

This Spring Boot application provides the functionality to manage accounts in iPYMT, including account creation, approval, and rejection. It also includes a mail service to send approval and rejection notifications to customers.

**Entities:**

* **Account:** Represents an account in iPYMT, with attributes for name, email, phone, and status.
* **AccountStatus:** An enum representing the different statuses an account can have (PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED).

**Services:**

* **AccountService:** Provides methods for creating, approving, and rejecting accounts.
* **MailService:** Provides methods for sending approval and rejection notifications to customers.

**Usage:**

To use this application, you can create an instance of the `AccountService` and use its methods to manage accounts. You can also create an instance of the `MailService` to send approval and rejection notifications.

**Example:**

The following code shows an example of how to use this application to create an account and send an approval notification:

```java
AccountService accountService = new AccountService();
Account account = new Account();
account.setName("John Smith");
account.setEmail("john.smith@example.com");
account.setPhone("123-456-7890");
accountService.createAccount(account);

MailService mailService = new MailService();
mailService.sendApprovalNotification(account);
```

**Additional Notes:**

* The application uses Spring Data JPA for data persistence.
* The mail service uses the JavaMailSender interface to send emails.
* The application can be configured to use a specific mail server by setting the `spring.mail` properties in the application.properties file.
