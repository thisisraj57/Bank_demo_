# Main Class Documentation

## Overview
The `Main` class demonstrates how to write a string to a file using Java's `FileOutputStream` and `OutputStream` classes. The program converts a string into bytes and writes those bytes to a file named `output.txt`.

## Class: Main

### Method: main
```java
public static void main(String args[])
```
The `main` method is the entry point of the program. It performs the following tasks:
1. Defines a string `data` that contains the text to be written to the file.
2. Uses a `FileOutputStream` to create (or overwrite if it already exists) a file named `output.txt`.
3. Converts the string `data` into a byte array.
4. Writes the byte array to the file.
5. Closes the output stream to release system resources.
6. Catches and handles any exceptions that may occur during the file operations.

#### Parameters
- `args`: An array of `String` arguments passed to the program (not used in this implementation).

#### Example Usage
```java
public static void main(String args[]) {
    String data = "This is a line of text inside the file.";

    try {
        OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");

        // Converts the string into bytes
        byte[] dataBytes = data.getBytes();

        // Writes data to the output stream
        out.write(dataBytes);
        System.out.println("Data is written to the file.");

        // Closes the output stream
        out.close();
    }

    catch (Exception e) {
        e.getStackTrace();
    }
}
```

### Exception Handling
The `main` method includes a `try-catch` block to handle any exceptions that might occur during file operations. If an exception is caught, the stack trace is retrieved using `e.getStackTrace()`.

### Important Notes
- The `FileOutputStream` class is used to write raw byte streams to a file.
- The `getBytes()` method of the `String` class is used to convert the string into a byte array.
- It is important to close the `OutputStream` after writing to the file to ensure that all resources are properly released.

### Output
When the program runs successfully, it prints the following message to the console:
```
Data is written to the file.
```

If an exception occurs, the stack trace of the exception will be printed to the console.

## Dependencies
- Java Standard Edition (SE) Development Kit (JDK)

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the `Main` class, use the following commands:

```sh
javac Main.java
java Main
```

After running the program, a file named `output.txt` will be created in the same directory as the `Main.java` file, containing the text "This is a line of text inside the file."
