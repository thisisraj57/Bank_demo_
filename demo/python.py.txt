**Function:** print

**Description:**
The `print` function in Python is used to display output to the console or other output devices. It takes one or more arguments, which are the values to be printed.

**Syntax:**

```python
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)
```

**Parameters:**

* **objects:** The values to be printed. These can be any type of object, such as strings, numbers, lists, or dictionaries.
* **sep:** (optional) The separator to be used between the objects. By default, a single space is used.
* **end:** (optional) The string to be printed at the end of the output. By default, a newline character is used.
* **file:** (optional) The file object to which the output should be written. By default, the output is written to the console.
* **flush:** (optional) A Boolean value indicating whether the output should be flushed immediately. By default, the output is buffered and flushed when the buffer is full or when the `flush` method is called.

**Return Value:**

The `print` function does not return any value.
