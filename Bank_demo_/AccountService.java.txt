**Class: AccountService**

**Description:**
Provides services for managing accounts in the system.

**Attributes:**

* **accountRepository:** An instance of the `AccountRepository` interface, which provides access to the database for CRUD operations on `Account` entities.

**Methods:**

* **openAccount:** Opens a new account for a customer.
* **onboardAccount:** Performs additional onboarding steps for a newly opened account, such as setting up initial account settings and sending welcome emails.

**Example Usage:**

```java
// Create an instance of the AccountService
AccountService accountService = new AccountService();

// Open a new account
Account account = accountService.openAccount(customer);

// Onboard the account
accountService.onboardAccount(account);
```

**Additional Notes:**

The `@Autowired` annotation is used to automatically wire the `accountRepository` dependency into the `AccountService` instance. This means that Spring will automatically create and inject an instance of the `AccountRepository` into the `AccountService` when it is instantiated.
