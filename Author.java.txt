```java
// The @Entity annotation is used to mark a class as a JPA entity.
@Entity
public class Author {

    // The @Id annotation is used to mark a field as the primary key of the entity.
    // The @GeneratedValue annotation is used to specify the strategy for generating the primary key.
    // The GenerationType.IDENTITY strategy generates the primary key automatically.
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    // The @Column annotation is used to map a field to a column in the database.
    private String name;
    private String description;
}
```

This code defines a JPA entity class for an author. The @Entity annotation is used to mark the class as a JPA entity. The @Id annotation is used to mark the `id` field as the primary key of the entity. The @GeneratedValue annotation is used to specify the strategy for generating the primary key. The GenerationType.IDENTITY strategy generates the primary key automatically.

The other fields (`name` and `description`) are mapped to columns in the database using the @Column annotation.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

- The `@Entity` annotation is used to mark the `Author` class as a JPA entity.
- The `@Id` annotation is used to mark the `id` field as the primary key of the entity.
- The `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` annotation is used to specify that the `id` field will be generated automatically by the database.
- The `private String name;` field represents the name of the author.
- The `private String description;` field represents the description of the author.
