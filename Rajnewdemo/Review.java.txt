# Review Class Documentation

## Overview
The `Review` class represents a review entity in a system. Each review is associated with a specific book and contains content describing the review. This class is typically used in the context of a book review application or a similar system where users can leave reviews for books.

## Annotations
- `@Id`: Specifies the primary key of the entity.
- `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`: Indicates that the primary key should be generated automatically with an identity column.
- `@ManyToOne`: Specifies a many-to-one relationship between `Review` and `Book`.
- `@JoinColumn(name = "book_id")`: Specifies the foreign key column (`book_id`) in the `Review` table that references the primary key of the `Book` table.

## Fields

### id
- **Type**: `Long`
- **Description**: The unique identifier for the review. This field is automatically generated and serves as the primary key for the `Review` entity.

### content
- **Type**: `String`
- **Description**: The content of the review. This field contains the text of the review provided by the user.

### book
- **Type**: `Book`
- **Description**: The book associated with this review. This field establishes a many-to-one relationship with the `Book` entity, indicating that multiple reviews can be associated with a single book.

## Methods

### Getters and Setters
The class includes standard getter and setter methods for each field. These methods allow for accessing and modifying the values of the fields.

#### getId
- **Returns**: `Long`
- **Description**: Returns the unique identifier of the review.

#### setId

## Example Usage
```java
Review review = new Review();

review.setBook(book);
```

In this example, a new `Review` object is created, its content is set, and it is associated with a `Book` object.

## Dependencies
- `javax.persistence.*`: The annotations used in this class are part of the Java Persistence API (JPA), which is used for mapping Java objects to database tables.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `Book` class is properly defined and annotated to work with JPA.
- The `Review` class relies on the JPA provider to manage the persistence and retrieval of `Review` objects from the database.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `Review` class, its fields, methods, and usage within a Java application using JPA for persistence.
