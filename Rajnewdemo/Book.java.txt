# Review Class Documentation

## Overview
The `Review` class represents a review entity in a system. Each review is associated with a specific book and contains content written by a user. This class is designed to be used with a relational database and is annotated for use with JPA (Java Persistence API).

## Annotations
- `@Id`: Specifies the primary key of the entity.
- `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`: Indicates that the primary key value will be automatically generated by the database.
- `@ManyToOne`: Specifies a many-to-one relationship between `Review` and `Book`.
- `@JoinColumn(name = "book_id")`: Specifies the foreign key column (`book_id`) in the `Review` table that references the primary key of the `Book` table.
