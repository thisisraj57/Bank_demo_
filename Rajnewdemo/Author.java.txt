# Author Class Documentation

## Overview
The `Author` class represents an author entity in a library management system. It includes attributes for the author's ID, name, and a list of books written by the author. The class uses JPA annotations to map the entity to a relational database.

## Annotations
- `@Entity`: Specifies that the class is an entity and is mapped to a database table.
- `@Id`: Specifies the primary key of the entity.
- `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`: Indicates that the primary key is automatically generated by the database.
- `@OneToMany(mappedBy = "author", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)`: Specifies a one-to-many relationship with the `Book` entity. The `mappedBy` attribute indicates that the `author` field in the `Book` entity owns the relationship. The `cascade = CascadeType.ALL` attribute specifies that all operations (persist, merge, remove, refresh, detach) should be cascaded to the related `Book` entities.

## Attributes
- `private Long id`: The unique identifier for the author. It is automatically generated by the database.
- `private String name`: The name of the author.
- `private List<Book> books`: A list of books written by the author. This establishes a one-to-many relationship with the `Book` entity.

## Methods
### Getters and Setters
The class includes standard getter and setter methods for each attribute.

#### `getId()`
- **Description**: Returns the ID of the author.
- **Returns**: `Long` - The ID of the author.

#### `setId(Long id)`
- **Description**: Sets the ID of the author.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `id` (`Long`): The ID to set.

#### `getName()`
- **Description**: Returns the name of the author.
- **Returns**: `String` - The name of the author.

#### `setName(String name)`
- **Description**: Sets the name of the author.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `name` (`String`): The name to set.

#### `getBooks()`
- **Description**: Returns the list of books written by the author.
- **Returns**: `List<Book>` - The list of books.

#### `setBooks(List<Book> books)`
- **Description**: Sets the list of books written by the author.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `books` (`List<Book>`): The list of books to set.

## Example Usage
```java
Author author = new Author();
author.setName("J.K. Rowling");

Book book1 = new Book();
book1.setTitle("Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone");
book1.setAuthor(author);

Book book2 = new Book();
book2.setTitle("Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets");
book2.setAuthor(author);

List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();
books.add(book1);
books.add(book2);

author.setBooks(books);

// Save the author entity to the database
entityManager.persist(author);
```

In this example, an `Author` object is created and two `Book` objects are associated with the author. The author and the books are then persisted to the database.
