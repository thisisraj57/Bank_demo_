# Review Class Documentation

## Overview
The `Review` class represents a review entity in a system that manages book reviews. Each review is associated with a specific book and contains content written by a user. This class is designed to be used with a JPA (Java Persistence API) implementation for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

## Annotations
- `@Id`: Specifies the primary key of the entity.
- `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`: Indicates that the primary key should be generated automatically by the database.
- `@ManyToOne`: Specifies a many-to-one relationship between `Review` and `Book`.
- `@JoinColumn(name = "book_id")`: Specifies the foreign key column in the `Review` table that references the primary key of the `Book` table.

## Fields

### id
- **Type**: `Long`
- **Description**: The unique identifier for the review.
- **Annotations**: 
  - `@Id`
  - `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`

### content
- **Type**: `String`
- **Description**: The content of the review written by the user.

### book
- **Type**: `Book`
- **Description**: The book that this review is associated with.
- **Annotations**: 
  - `@ManyToOne`
  - `@JoinColumn(name = "book_id")`

## Methods

### Getters and Setters
The class includes standard getter and setter methods for each field to allow for encapsulation and data manipulation.

#### getId
- **Description**: Returns the unique identifier of the review.
- **Returns**: `Long`

#### setId
- **Description**: Sets the unique identifier of the review.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `id` (`Long`): The unique identifier to set.

#### getContent
- **Description**: Returns the content of the review.
- **Returns**: `String`

#### setContent
- **Description**: Sets the content of the review.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `content` (`String`): The content to set.

#### getBook
- **Description**: Returns the book associated with the review.
- **Returns**: `Book`

#### setBook
- **Description**: Sets the book associated with the review.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `book` (`Book`): The book to set.

## Example Usage

```java
Review review = new Review();
review.setContent("This is a great book!");
Book book = new Book();
review.setBook(book);
```

This example demonstrates how to create a `Review` object, set its content, and associate it with a `Book` object.

## Dependencies
- `javax.persistence.*`: For JPA annotations and ORM functionality.
- `Book`: The `Book` class must be defined elsewhere in the codebase and should be a JPA entity.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `Book` class is properly annotated and mapped as a JPA entity.
- The `Review` class relies on the database to automatically generate the `id` field value.
