```java
// The @Entity annotation is used to mark a class as a JPA entity.
@Entity
public class Book {

    // The @Id annotation is used to mark a field as the primary key of the entity.
    // The @GeneratedValue annotation is used to specify the strategy for generating the primary key.
    // The GenerationType.IDENTITY strategy generates the primary key automatically.
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    // The @Column annotation is used to map a field to a column in the database.
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private String category;
    private String isbn;
    private int quantity;
}
```

This code defines a JPA entity class for a book. The @Entity annotation is used to mark the class as a JPA entity. The @Id annotation is used to mark the `id` field as the primary key of the entity. The @GeneratedValue annotation is used to specify the strategy for generating the primary key. The GenerationType.IDENTITY strategy generates the primary key automatically.

The other fields (`title`, `author`, `category`, `isbn`, and `quantity`) are mapped to columns in the database using the @Column annotation.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

- The `@Entity` annotation is used to mark the `Book` class as a JPA entity.
- The `@Id` annotation is used to mark the `id` field as the primary key of the entity.
- The `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` annotation is used to specify that the `id` field will be generated automatically by the database.
- The `private String title;` field represents the title of the book.
- The `private String author;` field represents the author of the book.
- The `private String category;` field represents the category of the book.
- The `private String isbn;` field represents the ISBN of the book.
- The `private int quantity;` field represents the quantity of the book.
