**Class:** ProductController

**Purpose:** This class is a REST controller that handles HTTP requests related to products.

**Properties:**

* **productService:** An instance of the ProductService class, which provides the business logic for products.

**Methods:**

* **getAllProducts():** This method handles GET requests to the "/products" endpoint. It retrieves all products from the database and returns them as a list.
* **createProduct(Product product):** This method handles POST requests to the "/products" endpoint. It creates a new product in the database using the provided product object and returns the newly created product.
* **// ... other CRUD operations:** Additional methods for handling other CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products.

**Annotations:**

* **@Autowired:** This annotation is used to automatically wire the productService property with an instance of the ProductService class.
* **@GetMapping:** This annotation is used to map the getAllProducts() method to HTTP GET requests.
* **@PostMapping:** This annotation is used to map the createProduct() method to HTTP POST requests.

**Example:**

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/products")
public class ProductController {
    @Autowired
    private ProductService productService;
    
    @GetMapping
    public List<Product> getAllProducts() {
        return productService.getAllProducts();
    }
    
    @PostMapping
    public Product createProduct(@RequestBody Product product) {
        return productService.createProduct(product);
    }
}
```

In this example, the ProductController class is a REST controller that handles HTTP requests for products. It has two methods: getAllProducts() and createProduct(), which are mapped to the "/products" endpoint for GET and POST requests, respectively.
