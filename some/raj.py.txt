## Vehicle Classes

This code defines three classes: `Car`, `Boat`, and `Plane`, each representing a different type of vehicle. Each class has an `__init__` method to initialize the vehicle's brand and model, and a `move` method to print a message indicating how the vehicle moves.

### Class Car

```python
class Car:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Drive!")
```

The `Car` class represents a car. It has two attributes: `brand` and `model`, which are initialized in the `__init__` method. The `move` method prints the message "Drive!" to indicate that the car is moving.

### Class Boat

```python
class Boat:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Sail!")
```

The `Boat` class represents a boat. It has two attributes: `brand` and `model`, which are initialized in the `__init__` method. The `move` method prints the message "Sail!" to indicate that the boat is moving.

### Class Plane

```python
class Plane:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Fly!")
```

The `Plane` class represents a plane. It has two attributes: `brand` and `model`, which are initialized in the `__init__` method. The `move` method prints the message "Fly!" to indicate that the plane is moving.

### Usage

The following code creates instances of the `Car`, `Boat`, and `Plane` classes and calls the `move` method on each instance:

```python
car1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang")       #Create a Car class
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza", "Touring 20") #Create a Boat class
plane1 = Plane("Boeing", "747")     #Create a Plane class

for x in (car1, boat1, plane1):
  x.move()
```

This code will print the following output:

```
Drive!
Sail!
Fly!
```
