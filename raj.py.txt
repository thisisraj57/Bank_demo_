**Function:** print

**Description:**
The `print` function in Python is used to display output to the console. It takes any number of arguments and prints them to the standard output device, usually the console or terminal.

**Syntax:**

```python
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)
```

**Parameters:**

* **objects:** The objects to be printed. These can be any type of data, such as strings, numbers, lists, or dictionaries.
* **sep (optional):** The separator to be used between the objects. By default, a single space is used.
* **end (optional):** The character to be printed at the end of the output. By default, a newline character is used.
* **file (optional):** A file-like object to which the output should be written. If not specified, the output is written to the standard output device.
* **flush (optional):** A boolean value indicating whether the output should be flushed immediately. By default, it is not flushed.

**Return Value:**

The `print` function does not return any value.

**Example:**

```python
print("Hello World")
```

Output:

```
Hello World
```

**Additional Notes:**

* The `print` function can be used to print multiple objects at once. The objects are separated by the `sep` parameter.
* The `end` parameter can be used to control the character that is printed at the end of the output.
* The `file` parameter can be used to redirect the output to a file or other file-like object.
* The `flush` parameter can be used to control whether the output is flushed immediately or buffered.
