**Class:** LibraryManagementApplication

**Purpose:** The main application class for a Spring Boot application for library management.

**Methods:**

* **main:** The entry point of the application. It uses the SpringApplication.run() method to launch the application.

**Example:**

```java
public class LibraryManagementApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(LibraryManagementApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

This code can be used to create a Spring Boot application for library management. The application can be launched by running the main method.
SpringApplication.run() method takes 2 arguments
1. Main application class
2. Command line arguments passed in the main method.

SpringApplication.run() starts the Spring application context, which is the heart of the Spring framework.
It detects beans, autowires them, and performs dependency injection.

SpringApplication.run() does more than just registering the annotated components in the context. It also does following things
1. Prepare and loads the application context.
   Context then is populated with all the beans found by class-path scanning
2. Activates all the beans in the context, invoking the init callbacks.
3. Checks for the ApplicationReadyEvent and publishes any ApplicationStartedEvent.
4. It also installs shutdown hooks to gracefully stop the application and perform related cleanups when the JVM exits (for example, when killed with SIGTERM or via Ctrl+C, or when the web server is stopped).

SpringApplication.run() blocks until the application context is closed.

Once the application context is closed, SpringApplication.run() method exits.
