Here is the Python code to check if a number is odd:

```python
# Function to check if a number is odd
def is_odd(number):
    """
    Check if the given number is odd.

    :param number: The number to check.
    :return: True if the number is odd, False otherwise.
    """
    return number % 2 != 0

# Example usage
number = 5
if is_odd(number):
    print(f"{number} is an odd number.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not an odd number.")
```

### Explanation:
- The code defines a function named `is_odd` that takes a single argument `number`.
- The function checks if the number is odd by using the modulus operator `%`. If the remainder when `number` is divided by 2 is not zero (`number % 2 != 0`), the number is odd.
- The function returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` otherwise.
- An example usage is provided where the function is called with the number `5`, and it prints whether the number is odd or not.
